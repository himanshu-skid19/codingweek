Hi, I'm Himanshu. I'm originally from New Delhi, currently residing in Lohit Hostel. My academic interests lie in Machine Learning, Astronomy, Web Dev, among other things. My hobbies range from reading novels like the Witcher, The Expanse, etc to watching Netflix Series. I also really like playing video games and listening to music (mainly pop music). I am not really a traveller but am fascinated by the prospect of exploring the Great Unknown: The Universe.

I m learning open source so that i can better manage my projects and collaborate with others in the campus on projects. I'm also interested in contributing to open source machine learning models which is why im doing open source here :).
